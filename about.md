a ackground in applied mathematics, statistics and love coding. Data analysis and machine learning
are what I current devote to.

My projects on Github:

> - [_GaussianProcess.jl_](https://github.com/linxihui/GaussianProcess.jl): a Julia package for Gaussian process regression and classification
> - [_GLMNet.jl_](https://github.com/linxihui/GLMNet.jl): a Julia package for elastic-net regularization
> - [_lazyML_](https://github.com/linxihui/lazyML): an R package to automatically select/tune models and hyper-parameters with different parallel backends
> - [_sml_](https://github.com/linxihui/sml): an R package extends general machine learning algorithms to survival data (developping)
> - [_deepLearning_](https://github.com/linxihui/deepLearning): a collection of C++ implemented deep learning algorithms which were first mean to help me better understanding deep learning. This code will be wrapped and called in R through Rcpp
